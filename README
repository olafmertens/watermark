This is an implementation of the watermark test.

It's a simple implementation that stores the resulting documents in memory. There is no persistence.
The result documents are removed from the store after an hour. Within that hour the documents can be fetched
with the WatermarkService.


Problems with the test description
----------------------------------

I don't understand the line
"The watermark of a book or a journal is identified by setting the watermark property of the object."
It should probably say
"The watermark of a book or a journal is identified by the watermark property of the object."


The watermark examples look like JSON strings, but the keys are not quoted. I think this is an error.
I quoted the keys in my implementation.



Things that should be changed in the code for a more robust implementation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Use dependency injection to set config values and implementation details.
- Use a persistent result repository. The implementation should be set by dependency injection.
- Use a pool of actors instead of a single actor to speed up the watermark processing.
